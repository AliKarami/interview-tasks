# interview-tasks
Each folder includes a task that we gave to interview candidates for various engineering positions.

Please consider:
* Do not push all of your code once it gets finished, the flow of the commits and development is important as well.
* A partially completed clean project is better than a working spaghetti.  
* If you have any questions about the tasks, please open a GitHub issue in this repository, and I will reply.
